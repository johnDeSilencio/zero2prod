  title: Email Newsletter Subscription API
  description: >
    This API supports the two following user scenarios:

    As a blog visitor,
    I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
    So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog

    As the blog author,
    I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
    So that I can notify them when new content is published.

    Unsupported behavior:
    - Unsubscribing from the email newsletter
    - Managing more than one newsletter
    - Segment groups of subscribers into multiple audiences
    - Track email user opening rates and click rates
